# Bash_List
A list data structure written in Bash. Bash doesn't provide neither dynamic structures nor C-style arays, so I wrote my list using files.

# Requirements
You need Git and Bash installed. Bash_List works on Linux, macOS and Windows 10 with WSL.

# How to use
1. Open `bash`
1. `cd` to a directory you like
1. Type
```
git clone https://github.com/NetherQuartz/Bash_List.git
cd Bash_List
./list.sh
```
Then you should see a very pretty menu (in Russian) and use my awesome program, enjoy!
